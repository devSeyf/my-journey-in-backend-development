# First Month in Backend World

First month for me in the backend world.

## Learning Node.js

First of all, I selected two resources for learning Node.js.

### First Resource  
**Node.js course – ITI scholarship**

This course is amazing because there are students in the videos, and in every video the students ask the teacher questions.  
It is not just a talking course.

**Total duration:**  
14:52:17  

**Videos count:**  
13  

**YouTube playlist:**

### Second Resource  
https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/default.asp

Because it is beautiful and also well divided.  
After each section, there are best practices, and this is amazing.
